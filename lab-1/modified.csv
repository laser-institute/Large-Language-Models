0,machines taught to do what humans do,Novice,"The student's response suggests an intermediate level of machine learning literacy. They have a basic understanding of the concept of machines being taught to mimic human behaviors and are able to reflect on the implications of this technology. However, their analysis lacks depth and technical knowledge that would be expected at an advanced level."
1,"I don't know what it means but if I had to guess, I would say it is how a machine processes and transfers data to learn.",Intermediate,The student can be categorized as an intermediate level in machine learning literacy. They have a basic understanding of the concept but may need further knowledge and exposure to advance to an advanced level.
2,A machine/computer's capacity to learn and recognize patterns from data and make predictions based on the pattern.,Advanced,Intermediate
3,I'm assuming it means that a machine can learn from it's own mistakes the same way a human does. Or it just means that a machine can learn things from watching other people do them.,Novice,"The student's machine learning literacy level is intermediate. They have a basic understanding of the concept of machines learning from their mistakes or from observing others, but may benefit from further exploration and study of more advanced concepts in machine learning."
4,I guess it might mean learning from machines.,Novice,The student demonstrates an intermediate level of machine learning literacy. They have a basic understanding of the concept of learning from machines but may benefit from further knowledge and experience in the field.
5,Machine learning is artificial intelligence. It is where machines are taught how to mimic human intelligence.,Intermediate,"Based on the response provided, the student demonstrates an intermediate level of machine learning literacy. They have a basic understanding of the concept, stating that it involves teaching machines to mimic human intelligence. They may benefit from further exploration and study of the topic to deepen their knowledge and understanding."
6,"The process of machines learning to mimic certain human behaviors, learning to become official artificial intelligence.",Intermediate,"Based on the response provided, the student demonstrates an intermediate level of machine learning literacy. They have a basic understanding of the concept of machines learning to mimic human behaviors and becoming official artificial intelligence, but may still require further knowledge and experience to delve into more complex aspects of machine learning."
7,Machine Learning is where a machine is taught using an algorithm to be able to understand patterns from data.,Advanced,"Based on the provided response, the student demonstrates an intermediate level of machine learning literacy. They have a basic understanding of the concept of machine learning and its purpose, but may need further explanations or examples to deepen their knowledge in the subject."
8,"Machine Learning is when AI uses a set of data to learn how to solve a problem. An example of this is the ice cream reviews, where based on the set of reviews, the AI determines certain words having positive or negative weights.",Advanced,"The student appears to have an intermediate level of machine learning literacy. They demonstrate an understanding of how AI uses data to learn and solve problems, as well as provide a specific example of sentiment analysis in ice cream reviews. They have a basic grasp of machine learning concepts but may benefit from further study to deepen their understanding."
